# 1,000 simulated pedigrees`

# [generation#] [#samples_to_print] <#branches> <branch_specifications>
# All individuals in a given branch and given generation have the same parents and so are full siblings of one another.
# To simulate a pedigree in which multiple full siblings each have children, increase the number of branches in the third <#branches> field.
# the field gives the number of full siblings to generate for each branch.

# [generation#] [#samples_to_print] <#branches>
# #branches = siblings w/n generation that have children
# #branches default gen 1 has 1 branch with 2 children
# gen 2 has 2 branchs, each a child of a child in branch 1
# subsequent branches has same number of branches as previous branch by default
